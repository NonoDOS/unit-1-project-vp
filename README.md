# Virtual Pet 

## Project Overview

This project is the first project for General Assembly-SEI(software engineering immersive) remote course which starts on 6/7/2021. The project is to choose game of your choice and build it in like a week using external liberies and framework .
I personally choose the virtual pet with the intention of testing out the animation with p5.js and other tools in the basic javascript knowledge.
